## Rationale

This Employee Polls Web App is an application that employees can use internally in order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company. From the dropdown menu employee has to choose his/her user, log in and then he/she can access the application and create a new poll with two proposed solutions. An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.
Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions has the most votes. There is also a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered.
Creating this project is one of the requirements to receive React Nanodegree from Udacity. This project was created to solidify my understanding of React and Redux.
